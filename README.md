# Loan Approval Classification Model

This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning project focused on loan approval classification. The goal of this project is to build and evaluate various machine learning models to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not.

Introduction
In this project, we use a dataset of loan application information to train and evaluate several machine learning models for loan approval classification. The dataset includes various features such as applicant's income, credit history, education level, and more. The main focus is to predict the target variable "Loan_Status," which indicates whether the loan was approved or not.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AmulyaKulkarni/loan-approval-classification.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd loan-approval-classification

3. Install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Data preprocessing: Preparing the data for model training.
Splitting data: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Building models: Building and training machine learning models using various algorithms.
Making predictions: Using trained models to make predictions on test data.
Evaluating models: Evaluating the performance of models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC curve, etc.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute code cells related to model building and evaluation.

As a result, you will have a trained machine learning model capable of predicting loan approval status based on input features.

You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset, understand the data distribution, and build a machine learning model for loan approval prediction. Modify and experiment with the code as needed.

Results
The project achieves an accuracy of around 0.79 using a logistic regression model. Further improvements can be made by optimizing hyperparameters, feature engineering, and exploring different algorithms.
